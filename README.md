# Rolex Watch Classification Application

Welcome to the Rolex Watch Classification Application! This app utilizes a deep learning classification model powered by fast.ai to accurately identify and classify images of Rolex watches into four of the most popular models: Daytona, Datejust, Submariner, and GMT-Master.

## Features
1. **Upload Your Image**: Upload your own image of a watch (Rolex or not), and the model will then read and display the image.
2. **Get Classification Result**: Once the image is uploaded, the model will process it and provide the predicted similarity to each model.
3. **Explore Default Images**: If you want to explore without uploading your own images, you can select from the default images provided.

You can see how the underlying classification model was built (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/code/ericfflynn/rolex-classification-model/notebook] on Kaggle.
